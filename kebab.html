    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      If you're familiar with the Greek gyros at your favorite takeout place,
      then you've eaten a derivation of a doner kebab. (It's also spelled d√∂ner
      kebab or doner kabob.) Doner kebabs are just one type of kebab, of which
      there are hundreds worldwide. Originating in Turkey, they're traditionally
      made of lamb, although today it's common to find them with a mixture of
      lamb and beef, or even exclusively beef.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Kebab</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound ground lamb (or 1/2 pound each of ground lamb and ground beef)
      </li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>4 clove garlic, peeled and finely minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      1 tablespoon oil, more for the pan
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Sandwich</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large pita, naan, or flatbread</li>
      <li>1 cup assorted lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 medium English cucumber, sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 large red onion, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>Tzatziki sauce or tahini sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, egg, garlic, ground cumin,
        ground coriander, smoked paprika, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the mixture into an oiled 9 x 5-inch loaf pan and cook in the oven
        for approximately 30 minutes or until the top is a light golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can slice the loaf immediately if you like but, for best results,
        cool completely, wrap in aluminum foil, and refrigerate until firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        To reheat, add a little olive oil to a large skillet, slice the loaf
        very thinly and crisp up the slices in the hot pan for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the sandwiches with pita, warmed and toasted through. Spread on
        some tzatziki or tahini sauce, add lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, and
        top with more sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
